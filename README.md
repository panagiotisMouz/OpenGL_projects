## OpenGL
Small Projects with OpenGL using GLEW GLFW GLM.                                                                                                                                     

# Project1
-Displaying a shape                                                                                                                                                                 
-When you are keep pressing the C key on your keyboard the shape changes                                                                                                           
-When you release the C key the shape changes back to the first shape           


# Project2
-Displaying a 3D Pyramid
