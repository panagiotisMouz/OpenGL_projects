#  OpenGL & Unity Graphics Projects

A collection of small graphics and simulation projects built using **OpenGL (C/C++)** and **Unity (C#)**. These projects explore rendering basics, user interaction, transformations, and simulation logic.

##  Technologies
- **OpenGL** with GLEW, GLFW, GLM  
- **C/C++** for OpenGL rendering  
- **Unity** (C#) for simulation and interactivity  
- Shaders, transformations, event handling

##  Projects

###  Project 1: Dynamic Shape Switcher (OpenGL)
- Renders a basic shape on screen
- Press-and-hold the `C` key to change the shape
- On key release, reverts to the original shape

### Project 2: 3D Pyramid (OpenGL)
- Renders a 3D pyramid using vertex data
- Supports real-time rotation and scaling via input controls

###  Project 3: Solar System Simulation (Unity/C#)
- Simulates a basic solar system with orbiting planets
- Planetary rotation and orbit speeds configurable
- Implemented with Unity engine and scripted in C#

##  How to Run

### For OpenGL Projects
1. Ensure GLEW, GLFW, and GLM are installed
2. Compile with a C++ compiler that supports OpenGL linking
3. Run the compiled binary and follow the key controls

### For Unity Simulation
1. Open the project in Unity Hub
2. Run the `SolarSystem.unity` scene
